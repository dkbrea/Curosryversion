## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#7957D6) to convey sophistication and modernity. Violet is a non-traditional but related alternative to colors more commonly associated with finances, like green or blue. It's also less visually similar to common colors like red (for debt) or black (for accounting).
- Background color: Light violet (#F2EEFD) to create a calming and uncluttered backdrop that lets the primary and accent colors pop.
- Accent color: Indigo (#4B0082) will direct user attention towards key elements and interactive components. This hue resides to the left of violet on the color wheel and has similar connotations of depth and regality.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font for readability and a tech-forward feel.
- Minimalist line icons to represent expense categories and actions.
- Simple, intuitive layout with a focus on data visualization. Important actions should be readily accessible.
